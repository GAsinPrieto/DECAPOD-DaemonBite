# DECAPOD USB, based on DaemonBite Retro Controllers To USB Adapters
## Introduction
Firmware for the DECAPOD adapter built by [Antonio Villena](https://www.antoniovillena.es/) for connecting SNES, NES, Mega Drive/Genesis (3/6-button), Master System, Atari, NEO GEO and PC Engine/TurboGrafX controllers to USB.

As it is based on MickGyver's work, the input lag for this adapter is also minimal.

## Building the projects
You will need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to build the project. Download the repository via the "Clone or download" button, open the project (.ino extension) in the IDE and select "Arduino Leonardo" in Tools / Board. Connect the Arduino to a USB port and build/upload from Scetch / Upload.
